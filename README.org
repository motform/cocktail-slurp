  An unsolicited misrepresentation of [[https://cocktailvirgin.blogspot.com][the internets foremost experimental cocktail repository]].

** Why post a website on Github?
   Good question! Someone once said that “publishing your website in a public repository is almost always a bad idea”, and they where probably right. Still, good advice is there to be ignored. I guess I like having a reliable and easily accessible backup around. It’s also nice to post some live examples of full stack Clojure configurations. cocktail-slurp uses a [[https://www.datomic.com][Datomic Free]] in the back with some [[https://github.com/day8/re-frame][re-frame]] in the front, which is not a combination I found all to many examples of. It does in no way represent best practices or production quality code, but that’s not always a bad thing.

** Instructions
   Note that cocktail-slurp is set in [[https://www.swisstypefaces.com/fonts/suisse/][Suisse Int'l]], whose Book weight is available for free on the foundry website. Without it, the CSS falls back to whatever your browser sets ~sans-serif~ to.

   To run a development version of the both the front- and back-end, run ~make dev~. The ~Makefile~ also contains commands to run and deploy jars (~make jar~) and docker containers (~make docker~).
