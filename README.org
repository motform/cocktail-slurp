An unsolicited misrepresentation of [[https://cocktailvirgin.blogspot.com][the internets foremost experimental cocktail repository]].

** Development
   Things will most likely break/look strange if you do not have the required typefaces. Suisse Int’l is proprietary, but can be acquired free of charge [[https://www.swisstypefaces.com/fonts/suisse/#font][here]].

*** Server
    Simply run ~clj -A:server~. 

*** Front-end
    Before I make nice aliases etc, you can run ~npx shadow-cljs watch~ (preferably via CIDER) for development or ~npx shadow-cljs compile app~ for some kind of deployment.
    
** Deployment
   TBA, docker or uberjar or whatever
